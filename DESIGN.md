# Design Documentation for Googom

## System Architecture

Googom is structured into five main contexts, each dedicated to handling specific aspects of data management within the same application framework.

### Detailed Contexts

1. **HTTP Server**
    - Utilizes Boost.Beast for handling HTTP requests and responses in JSON format.

2. **TCP Server**
    - Manages binary data over TCP using Boost libraries, optimized for both internal and external data transfers.

3. **Data Writer**
    - Writes data to memory and validates it against a schema to ensure consistency and integrity.

4. **Data Dumper**
    - Periodically dumps data from memory to disk to ensure durability and supports disaster recovery.

5. **Governance**
    - Centralized management of data access rules, user permissions, and compliance protocols.

### Data and Topic Management

- **Topics**: Defined to handle different types of data, such as text, JSON, and timeseries, each with potential schema enforcement.
- **Persistence and Buffering**: Ensures all data within topics is persistent with buffers at both ends for optimal data retrieval.
- **Topic Events**: Customizable notifications for schema changes or deletions enhance interaction with downstream systems.

### Security and Data Governance

- **Encryption and Security**: Implements comprehensive security measures including data encryption and secure communication channels.
- **Governance Policies**: Enforces data governance standards, including metadata registration, data quality checks, and schema versioning.

### Performance Considerations

- **Low Latency Data Handling**: Minimizes data movement among contexts to maintain high throughput and low latency.
- **Scalability**: Supports horizontal scaling through dynamic topic partitioning and replication based on node availability.

## Future Enhancements

- **AI Integration**: Plans to incorporate artificial intelligence for predictive data management and enhanced analytical capabilities.
- **Expansion of Data Formats**: Aims to increase the range of supported data formats and interaction protocols.
